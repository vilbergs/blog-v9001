The photograph you see featured in this post is taken from one of my proudest moments in my life.
There I am in the center, in the zone; competing in the finals in Iceland's "Battle of the bands",
or Músíktilraunir (Music Experiments), which is hosted annually in Reykjavík's concert hall Harpa.

Now why am I bringing this up here and why do I consider this such a significant achievement? I didn't even win?..
Well, it's because less than a year prior to this evening I didn't even play bass...

### A Few Years Later

Fast forward, I am sitting in an office building in semi-central Gothenburg, Sweden, writing
this premiere blog post to kick off my website. And while the contents of future posts are likely to
be a bit more more specific I would like to seize the opportunity to provide a little context.

Around the time of not winning this renown music competition I was planning a trip through Central Europe.
My job was rather uninspiring and the apartment I was renting had just been sold.
I wanted so badly to get inspired by something, somewhere; I wanted to, wait for it...
_"find myself..."_.

Little did I know that I would end up here. In Sweden. Gothenburg...
But with a little spontaneity, a stroke of luck (we can just call it hard work)
and no small amount of help I've learned to call this city home.
Home sweet home, almost four years later, I am an aspiring software developer, amateur photographer and band quitter.

### Aspiring Software Developer

When I arrived here it became apparent to me that the tech industry was booming in Gothenburg,
and being a bit of a techie I promptly picked up my bass and showed up for band practice.
Practice being countless painful interviews, long evening studies and whole lot of imposter syndrome.

I'm going in on my third year as a professional developer. Making it into this career is
also one of my proudest achievements, it just didn't make the cover as it's not as cool as rocking out on stage.

This website will undoubtably be rather focused on development topics,
aside from showcasing my photos!

### Amateur photographer

Since January last year I've also found a deep passion for photography. I was completely open for it
just being a short term craze but I've really not been able to let it go.
For a while now I've wanted a platform where I can showcase some of my best work,
without the restriction of social media platforms

I suppose pictures speak for themselves, so head on to the [Porfolio](/portfolio) if you're curious!

### Band Quitter (The show must go on)

If you're with me this far, it's time to face the music.

Music is and always will be a huge part of my life. But I've come to terms with the fact
that my code and my photos are more important to me than being a rockstar...
Not going back to Iceland meant not being a part of that band anymore, but that band had already
set the tone for the years to come, because I learned that it's all about just starting somewhere.
